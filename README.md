# Simon-Game :video_game:

The game presents you with a sequence of colored buttons. Your task is to memorize and then replicate the sequence precisely by pressing the buttons in the correct order. Each successful round adds another color to the sequence, gradually increasing the difficulty and testing your ability to remember.


## Deployment :rocket:

To deploy this project go to this Website

```bash
  https://legend-raj.github.io/Simon-Game/
```


## Features :sparkles:

- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Randomly generated color sequences
- Increasing difficulty with each round
- Score tracking


## Learning Objectives :innocent:

- JavaScript Fundamentals: This project delves into core JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation (selecting and interacting with HTML elements), event handling (responding to user actions like button clicks), and potentially sound manipulation (playing sounds for each button).
-  Logic and Problem-solving: You'll need to design the logic for generating random sequences, tracking player input, and determining success or failure. This fosters problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.
- Memory and Focus: By its very nature, the Simon Game challenges your memory and ability to concentrate on the displayed sequences.
